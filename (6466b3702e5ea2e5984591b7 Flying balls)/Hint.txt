The problem is that two moving balls are given, find the collide point between those two balls.
We only find the collide time and then, we can move two balls into their collide points.
If, then, we can easily find the collide points between two balls.
To do this, first, we should know about the relative speed in this problem.
By using relative speed, we can stop one ball.
And then, to find the collide point, we can change this problem from "find collide time between two balls" into "finding collide time between point and one big ball".
(Here the radius of the big ball is the sum of radius of two given balls.)
This new problem is simpler than the first given problem, and we can solve this problem using the distance between point and line in 3D plane.
